# Final Project Proposal: إجـــاده

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
Our project aims to develop a user-friendly chatbot to assist users in search the extensive range of technical and professional courses and bootcamps available on the Tuwaiq Academy and Star platforms. Users often face challenges in identifying appropriate starting points, necessary skills, tools to learn, and desired job titles, leading to confusion and inefficiency. Leveraging comprehensive datasets from Tuwaiq Academy and Star, the chatbot will provide personalized and relevant course recommendations. Its primary functionalities will include detailed course information, keyword-based search capabilities, and an interactive, user-friendly interface. By analyzing users' backgrounds, interests, and career goals, the chatbot will guide them in specifying desired skills, tools, or job titles, recommending suitable training options to enhance their learning journeys and career prospects.
